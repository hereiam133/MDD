OK so a ton of work has been done so far.
CakePHP installed

All files written and uploaded to dummy server.

Currently working on Facebook login api integration.

dummy site is up at http://mdd.simplydone.org

admin access will allow you more control including creating more admins
for admin access login with

user:   admin

Facebook Login is now properly functioning.
next update will be facebook share
As their is no real profile info, I am currently not coding an edit profile section.

Due to the setup of the facebook API you will have to test it out on the dummy server as 
it will only work from there.   http://mdd.simplydone.org
feel free to login and post something!
currently only have dummy text up.
once final updates are made then I will begin the mobile layout
